$ belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory
$ never pulled that gun in anger
the middle third of the baseball bat turned into a column of burning sawdust accelerating in all directions like a bursting star
$ ended up holding this bat handle with milky smoke pouring out the end
since then $ has kept the gun in the glove compartment
he will come away from the whole thing feeling that, somehow, he owes $ a favor
underneath is naught but billowing pale flesh
$ went celibate for a while
he just wants this over with
he has a little yard all to himself
they stomp the cigarettes out on the concrete with their cheap vinyl shoes
there's not much more for $ to do
$ pulls up the guy's picture so he'll recognize him
the babbling would spread throughout the van like a contagious disease
it just seemed embarrassingly stupid to her
she could hear nothing but singing and chanting
the big stout Russian chicks—stomping, slab-faced babushkas—keep giving $ a hassle
she goes on to tell him a highly entertaining story about $
he has no trouble finding the canal that leads to the next neighborhood
it will actually enhance their sense of duty.
$ turns away, shamed and awed
i took it upon myself to shoot him in the back of the head
it's better to be conservative and take what you can get than take a big gamble and blow it
