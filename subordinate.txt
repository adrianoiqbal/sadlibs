when they gave him the job
when $ puts the hammer down
because people rely on him
if the thirty-minute deadline expires
since $ was fourteen years old
as $ approaches the Street
despite her lack of color and shitty resolution,
the first time $ saw her
at the same time
when they both wound up working at the Arts Board
When $ father died
no matter how good it is
if they live nearby
as she drags it backward towards $
so when someone does something bad
then he begins to walk slowly toward $
now that he works for the Arts Board
as $ crests the pass on his motorcycle at five in the morning
apparently because he was drunk
as $ enters
if they're smart, and aggressive
when she first woke up
as far as $ could tell from this admittedly poor vantage point
after she had a few minutes to freshen up
a couple of times every hour
three times a day
once $ gets over the shock of it and settles into a routine
from time to time
when he exits the neon skyscraper
until half an hour ago
when they came out here
if he screws this up
when they set down to pick up $
as he's turning away to protect himself
